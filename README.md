# Aspiring Data Scientist Community

We are a welcoming and accessible community for both new and experienced Data Scientists (and Data Analysts and Data Engineers, etc.) to connect. This Community is a little different from some of the other local DS Community, as it is meant to focus more on outreach and sharing what it's like to work with data as a career than technical talks and tutorials. 

This community is open to all experience levels, especially those who love data and don't know where to start and those who are passionate about helping. Come join us for mentoring, collaboration, leveling up our skills, and hopefully some fun social events like happy hours! 

Please make sure to join both meetup and slack group to keeo yourself update. Links are below:
